https://codepen.io/ThibaultJanBeyer/pen/NzPVVX?editors=0110

# Key Features

- No dependencies.

- Extremely easy to use.
- Vanilla Javascript.
- Less than 80 lines of code.
- Ultra-Lightweight, less than ~1KB gzipped.
- Ultra-Fast.

# Browser Support

It works on all the latest browsers. However, as I’m using native classes other ES6 functionality:  
- \>=Edge 16 

# Why?

Well well, I stumbled upon the commercial tool https://www.landbot.io/ and wanted to use it. However the pricing is crazily inhuman, as time of writing, landbot.io would cost you 20€/month which is insane. So I quickly searched the web and quickly found [botui](https://github.com/botui/botui) which is basically what I was searching for. I started using it but figured out that it is overcomplicated: Firstly, for the messages they wrote their own subset of markup language. Why the fudge?… No idea. Secondly, it seems abandonned, it has currently 20 open issues. Lastly, and that was the reason why I did not contribute to the project but wrote my own, it has a dependency to VUE.js! Why in the world would you need a library for this?… Also more specificly requires `vuejs version 2.0.5` a newer version will break the functionality. This is some core desision of the tool I would not want to participate. So here it is, a dead simple landing bot alternative that consists of less than 80 lines of code. Enjoy.

# Installation

## Easy

Just download the file and add it to your document:
```
<script src="https://thibaultjanbeyer.github.io/ui-landing-bot/dist/uilb.min.js"></script>
```
If you want to add the default styling add the CSS file as well:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://thibaultjanbeyer.github.io/ui-landing-bot/dist/uilb.min.js">
```

# Usage

Pass the node that you want to have the bot rendered into:
```
const uilb = new UILandingBot(document.body);
```
That’s it! Now you can use it to create awesome stories that get visitors hooked.

## Messages

# Syntax

```
uilb.message({options})
```

### Example:
```
uilb.message({
      content: "Hey! 👋",
      delay: 1000
})
```
Will write `Hey! 👋` on behalf of the bot after 1 Second delay.  
A message returns a promise. So, you can chain multiple messages onto another:

```
uilb.message({
      content: "Hey! 👋",
      cssClass: "no-icon",
      delay: 1000
})
.then(ok => 
   uilb.message({
      content: "How are you?",
      delay: 1000
   })
);
```
Will write `Hey! 👋` on behalf of the bot after 1 second, then after another second the bot will write `How are you?`.  
If you want to write on behalf of the user just set `human: true` like so:

```
uilb.message({
      content: "Hey! 👋",
      cssClass: "no-icon",
      delay: 1000
})
.then(ok => 
   uilb.message({
      content: "How are you?",
      delay: 1000
   })
)
.then(ok => 
   uilb.message({
      content: "Good",
      human: true,
      delay: 2000
   })
);
```
Hurray! This already makes up a fine conversation between bot and human!

## Actions

### Syntax

```
uilb.action({options})
```

### Example:

Actions add interactivity for the user. For example you could, like this, let the user choose an answer:
```
uilb.message({
      content: "Hey! 👋 <br>How are you?",
      delay: 1000
})
.then(ok =>
   uilb.action({
      type: "button",
      items: [
          {
          text: "cat",
          value: "meow!"
          },
          {
          text: "awesome",
          value: "awesum!"
          }
      ]
  })
)
.then( answer => console.log(answer) );
```

This will display two buttons. One with the text `cat` and the other one reading `awesome`. When the user clicks on `cat` the `console.log` will be `meow!`. Because it resolves the value of the clicked button.
