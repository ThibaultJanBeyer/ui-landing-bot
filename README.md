# Key Features

- No dependencies.

- Extremely easy to use.
- Vanilla Javascript.
- Less than 80 lines of code.
- Ultra-Lightweight, less than ~1KB gzipped.
- Ultra-Fast.

# Browser Support

It works on all the latest browsers. However, as I‚Äôm using native classes other ES6 functionality:  
- \>=Edge 16 

# Why?

Well, I stumbled upon the commercial tool https://www.landbot.io/ and wanted to use it. However ~the pricing is crazily inhuman~, as time of writing, landbot.io would cost you ~30‚Ç¨/month which is insane~ (they have a free tier now). So I quickly searched the web and quickly found [botui](https://github.com/botui/botui) which is basically what I was searching for. I started using it, but figured out that it is overcomplicated: Firstly, regarding messages, they wrote their own subset of markup language. Wait what?‚Ä¶ No idea. Secondly, it seems abandoned, it has currently ~20~ 60 open issues. Lastly, and that was the reason why I did not contribute to the project but wrote my own: it has a dependency to vue.js! Why in the world would you need a library for such a small tool?‚Ä¶ Also, more precisely, requires vuejs version 2.0.5, a newer version won‚Äôt work and break the tool. As, this is some core decision, I would not want to participate in developing it further. So here it is, a dead simple landing bot alternative that consists of less than 80 lines of code. Enjoy üßÄ

# Installation

## Easy

Just download the file and add it to your document:
```
<script src="https://thibaultjanbeyer.github.io/ui-landing-bot/dist/uilb.min.js"></script>
```
If you want to add the default styling add the CSS file as well:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://thibaultjanbeyer.github.io/ui-landing-bot/dist/uilb.min.css">
```

# Usage

Pass the node that you want to have the bot rendered into:
```
const uilb = new UILandingBot(document.body);
```
That‚Äôs it! Now you can use it to create awesome stories that get visitors hooked.

## Messages

### Syntax

```
uilb.message({options})
```

### Example:
```
uilb.message({
      content: "Hey! üëã",
      delay: 1000
})
```
Will write `Hey! üëã` on behalf of the bot after 1 Second delay.  
A message returns a promise. So, you can chain multiple messages onto another:

```
uilb.message({
      content: "Hey! üëã",
      cssClass: "no-icon",
      delay: 1000
})
.then(ok => 
   uilb.message({
      content: "How are you?",
      delay: 1000
   })
);
```
Will write `Hey! üëã` on behalf of the bot after 1 second, then after another second the bot will write `How are you?`.  
If you want to write on behalf of the user just set `human: true` like so:

```
uilb.message({
      content: "Hey! üëã",
      cssClass: "no-icon",
      delay: 1000
})
.then(ok => 
   uilb.message({
      content: "How are you?",
      delay: 1000
   })
)
.then(ok => 
   uilb.message({
      content: "Good",
      human: true,
      delay: 2000
   })
);
```
Hurray! This already makes up a fine conversation between bot and human!

## Actions

### Syntax

```
uilb.action({options})
```

### Example:

Actions add interactivity for the user. For example you could, like this, let the user choose an answer:
```
uilb.message({
      content: "Hey! üëã <br>How are you?",
      delay: 1000
})
.then(ok =>
   uilb.action({
      type: "button",
      items: [
          {
          text: "cat",
          value: "meow!"
          },
          {
          text: "awesome",
          value: "awesum!"
          }
      ]
  })
)
.then( answer => console.log(answer) );
```

This will display two buttons. One with the text `cat` and the other one reading `awesome`. When the user clicks on `cat` the `console.log` will be `meow!`. Because it resolves the value of the clicked button.
